# Interactive 3D Knowledge Graph Builder (PS9)

This project automatically builds an interactive 3D knowledge graph of a student's
skills and learning progression by aggregating data from GitHub and other sources.

## Modules
- ML Engine: Skill extraction & progression (NLP)
- Backend: APIs, auth, data orchestration
- Graph Engine: Knowledge graph construction
- Frontend: Interactive 3D visualization

## Team
- Sadgyan Singh – ML/DL & System Lead
- Anshika – Backend Engineer
- **Shashikant – Graph Engineer** (Knowledge graph design, nodes & relations, Project-Skill relationships, graph queries & update logic)
- Ashish Raj – Frontend Engineer

## Graph Engineer Responsibilities (Shashikant)
- Design and maintain the knowledge graph schema
- Manage node types and relationships for Student, Project, and Skill entities
- Build and optimize Cypher queries for graph operations
- Implement Project-Skill relationship logic and importance levels
- Handle skill prerequisite definitions and learning paths
- Provide skill gap analysis across student projects

See [GRAPH_ENGINEER_ROLE.md](GRAPH_ENGINEER_ROLE.md) for detailed responsibilities and structure.
